/**
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

 * Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function
 * should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
 * The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers,
 * with '#' signifying the end of each level.
